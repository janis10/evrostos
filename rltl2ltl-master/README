RLTL2LTL is a tool to translate rLTL formulas into LTL formulas.


Requirements
------------
RLTL2LTL requires JavaCC (https://javacc.org/) and the Apache ANT build tool
(http://ant.apache.org/). If necessary, please consult the corresponding
websites for further information.


Compiling the sources
---------------------
The sources can easily be compiled using ANT. Simply perform the following two
steps:

1) Change into the directory containing the file build.xml and run the command
   'ant'.

   By default, JavaCC is assumed to be located in /usr/share/java/. If JavaCC is
   installed in another directory (e.g., if you are not running Linux), set the
   environment variable JAVACC_HOME to the appropriate directory JavaCC prior to
   running ant.

   After the sources have been compiled successfully, the class files are
   located in ./build.

2) Run the command 'ant jar' to create a .jar file called rltl2ltl.jar, which is
   placed in the current directory.

To generate Javadoc documentation of the sources. run 'ant generate_javadoc'.

To clean all generated files, run 'ant clean'.


Running RLTL2LTL
----------------
To run RLTL2LTL, execute 'java -jar rltl2ltl.jar' with the desired options. Use
the -h option to display further information.
